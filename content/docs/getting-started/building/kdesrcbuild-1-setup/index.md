KDE uses a custom tool called [kdesrc-build](https://invent.kde.org/sdk/kdesrc-build) for setting up a development environment and building KDE software.

You only need to set up your environment once, and then you can compile (and recompile) KDE software as often as needed.

Setting up your environment on a Linux machine is fairly simple. You'll need to install a few programs to get started.
